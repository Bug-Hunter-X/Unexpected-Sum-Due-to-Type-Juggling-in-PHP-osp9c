This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP: unexpected results from arithmetic operations due to loose typing.  The `bug.php` file contains code that calculates the sum of an array. However, the array includes a string element, which leads to type juggling and an inaccurate sum. The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates how to fix this by using strict type checking and ensuring all array elements are numeric.
